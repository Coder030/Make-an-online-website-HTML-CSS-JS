<h1 style="text-align: center;">On Captain Rogers!</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">I will be talking about Captain America! Captain America has become a popular and beloved character over the years after appearing in comics in 1941 and after making his debut on the big screen in 2011. Captain America quickly became one of the most iconic comic book characters ever due to his boy scout personality and patriotic values. When Captain America debuted in 1941, he was seen to be fighting the Axis Powers in his adventures, which is expected since he made his debut in the middle of World War II. After the war, the Captain America comics were discontinued but were eventually revived in 1964. Captain America’s outfit’s primary inspiration is the American flag, which includes red gloves and boots, a primary blue suit, with a big white star on his chest and stripes on his stomach area. Cap’s iconic indestructible shield also has stripes and a star on it as well. As you can probably tell, no one loves America as much as Captain America.

    However, “Captain America” is just an alter ego. Steve Rogers was a young, small man from Brooklyn, New York that joined the US military. Steve Rogers was also really frail and sickly-looking and was eventually injected by an experimental serum that made him peak human perfection that improved every physical aspect of his body, and therefore, Captain America was born. The serum was called the “Super Soldier Serum” and it also aided the Allied Powers in their fight against the Axis Powers during World War II. After Rogers became Captain America and fought along side the Allied Powers, Cap was suspended in ice and was revived decades later in the present day. After reemerging from being “asleep” in the ice for years, he struggled adjusting to present day norms, but despite that, his golden personality and loyalty to others kept him (and presumably others) afloat and Steve eventually went on to continue to fight for what he believed in with The Avengers.</h2>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">On Iron Stark!</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Iron Man is one of those few superheroes representing a more “realistic” take on what might be possible. As I wrote in “Inventing Iron Man—The Possibility of a Human Machine”, his origin story has some very plausible bits to it. This makes him seem more accessible as a character. But its accessing the mind of the Golden Avenger—connecting the Iron Man exoskeleton to Tony Starks brain—that is the main focus here. Starting in utero, a calibration of the motor and sensory inputs to and from your body parts began. This process has continued in your brain throughout your life. This results in a loose “mapping” of neurons that goes on in the somatosensory and motor parts of your brain. As a result you have multiple representations of your body in your brain. This gives rise to our sense of self, body “image”, and body “schema”.

    These representations have been refined and tuned throughout your life along with your changing body size and the experiences youve had. Except in the case of tragic accidents where a limb may have been lost or amputated, your body has always been there with you 24/7. Your body is you and its there all the time.
    
    It turns out that tool use can alter these representations. But tools that we use arent part of our body and arent with us all the time. At least not physically. But are they with us in our brains? We use tools only when we need them (we always need our bodies). It turns out that the sensory maps of our bodies in our brains can be reshaped to include parts of the way we use tools.
